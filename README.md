# Pair-Programming tasks for LOFINO

## Getting started

Run `npm install`

There are three tasks here: `countLetters`, `myReduce` and `findString`.

For all of those there are already tests. You can run them with the respective build script: `npm run test:countLetters` etc.

## countLetters

This task is about implementing a feature. The function should count the letters in an input string.

## myReduce

Also about implementation. Implement the `Array.prototype.reduce()` function in a custom function. It might be a little harder to do.

## findString

There are at least two bugs here, find and fix them
